Ingredients:

1.5 – 2 lbs of Brussels Sprouts, halved with bottom stalk cut off
4 strips of thick bacon, chopped (kitchen shears come in very handy here. The bacon is also TOTALLY optional in case you’re a vegetarian – it just adds additional flavor)
1 – 2 tbsp of almonds, chopped
1/4 cup low sodium soy sauce
2 tbsp of Sriracha
1 tbsp of rice vinegar
2 tbsp of sesame oil
1/4 tsp of crushed red pepper flakes
1/4 tsp of cayenne pepper
2 tsp of garlic powder
1 tsp of onion powder
1 tbsp of paprika


Instructions:  
On the Instant Pot, hit “Sauté” and “Adjust” so it’s on “More” or “High” setting. 
When it reads “Hot,” add the bacon and almonds, stirring often. 
Cook for 3-4 minutes so bacon is nice and cooked 
    (it’s okay if it sticks a little to the pan and when the bottom of the pan is pretty brown, 
    that’s your cue that it’s done cooking)
Mix all of the liquids and seasonings together in a bowl to create the sauce
Put the Brussels Sprouts in the Instant Pot and add sauce. Stir until everything is coated.
Secure lid and set on “Manual” or “Pressure Cook” High Pressure for 3 minutes 
    (2 minutes if you want them a little firmer)
Quick release
Enjoy!
